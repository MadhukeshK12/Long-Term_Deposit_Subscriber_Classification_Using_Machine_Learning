# Abstract:
The primary aim of this study is to utilize supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of bank customers opting to a term subscription plan i.e.  a term deposit plan in a bank telemarketing campaign. The goal is to create a prediction model that correctly categorises client preferences, enabling efficient resource management and focused marketing tactics. To build a predictive model, three distinct machine learning algorithms were employed: logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision tree algorithms. From the results, SVM achieved the best performance of 76% compared to other models.
